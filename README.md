# React-Hooks-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-App
This project demonstrates how to build a complete full-stack web application by integrating Spring Boot as the backend and React (with React Hooks) as the frontend. The application includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and leverages MySQL as the database for data storage and retrieval.

## Features
## Backend: Spring Boot framework for building robust and scalable APIs.
## Frontend: React with React Hooks for an efficient and modern user interface.
## Database: MySQL for structured data management.
## Functionality: Implements full CRUD operations.
## This project serves as a comprehensive example for developing full-stack applications with modern technologies.
